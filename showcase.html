        "I have written <a href="https://makeourbook.com">makeourbook.com</a> to bring publishing to the classroom. I'm
        particularly pleased with the use of the table of contents for navigation: it is a chance to improve my JavaScript
        which is not my strength. I am using <a
          href="https://react-beautiful-dnd.netlify.com/?path=/story/single-vertical-list--basic">React Beautiful DND</a>.
        This summer I'm working on the Purchase workflow so orders are more automated, and on more layout options for
        schools."

        "For Side Project Summer 2019, I tried to get to grips with making API calls in Ruby.
        I built a site that interacts with the <a href="https://consonance.app/docs/product-api">Consonance Product API</a>
        to fetch metadata for books published by the <a href="https://sas.ac.uk/publications">University of London Press</a>,
        where I work. I learned plenty of useful stuff about APIs along the way, a lot of which has now become relevant to
        my role at the Press. Read more about how it works <a href="https://jbowman.dev/projects/side-project-summer-2019">here</a>.
        Currently in the process of scoping out my project for Side Project Summer 2020!"

      <h2>Paint Pad</h2>

        "<a href="https://paintpad.app">Paint Pad</a> is a website for creating, sharing and discovering recipes for
        painting miniatures (tiny plastic models that you play tabletop games with).

        It is built using <a href="https://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href="http://reactjs.org">React</a>. Last
        year for
        the inaugural Side Project Summer I prepped the site for launch, and then worked on various fixes and improvements,
        including some <a href="https://paintpad.app/circles">randomly generated circles</a>.
        <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=(from%3A%40andypearson)%20%23SideProjectSummer">You can see all the details on
          Twitter</a>.

        This year, I want to improve the site by adding new tools and features to make it an even more
        useful resource for beginners and experts alike."

      <h2>Learn Ionic React</h2>

        "Last year, I started to learn <a href="https://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> just before Side Project Summer
        started, and used it to build the first version of <a href="https://umbrellaanalytics.net/">Umbrella Analytics</a> -
        something that's turned (thanks to a year of part-time work) into a service that real people use and like! This year,
        though, I'm going to learn some more JavaScript - specifically, <a
          href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/your-first-app">the Ionic framework</a>. This is so I can work alongside
        my 18-year-old son, who wants to build an app for recording archery scores (a hobby we share). I already know some JS
        but Ionic and React are completely new to me, and a little scary!
