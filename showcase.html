        "I have written <a href="https://makeourbook.com">makeourbook.com</a> to bring publishing to the classroom. I'm
        particularly pleased with the use of the table of contents for navigation: it is a chance to improve my JavaScript
        which is not my strength. I am using <a
          href="https://react-beautiful-dnd.netlify.com/?path=/story/single-vertical-list--basic">React Beautiful DND</a>.
        This summer I'm working on the Purchase workflow so orders are more automated, and on more layout options for
        schools."

        "For Side Project Summer 2019, I tried to get to grips with making API calls in Ruby. 
        I built a site that interacts with the <a href="https://consonance.app/product-api">Consonance Product API</a> 
        to fetch metadata for books published by the <a href="https://sas.ac.uk/publications">University of London Press</a>, 
        where I work. I learned plenty of useful stuff about APIs along the way, a lot of which has now become relevant to 
        my role at the Press. Read more about how it works <a href="https://jbowman.dev/projects/side-project-summer-2019">here</a>.
        Currently in the process of scoping out my project for Side Project Summer 2020!"
