          Use a static site generator such as
          <a class="secondary-link" href="https://middlemanapp.com/">https://middlemanapp.com/</a>,
          <a class="secondary-link" href="https://gatsby.js">https://gatsby.js</a> or
          <a class="secondary-link" href="https://gohugo.io/">https://gohugo.io/</a>.
          Or if you prefer to avoid using a framework, you could copy the <a class="secondary-link" href="https://github.com/GeneralProducts/side-project-summer">code of this Side Project Summer website</a>, which is pure HTML
          and CSS, and use it as the basis for your own. Try hosting your website on <a class="secondary-link" href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> for free.

          The General Products team ran a Day of Code at the last FutureBook, which saw 40 publishers create their own book marketing website from raw ONIX metadata.
          <a class="secondary-link" href="https://dayofcode.co.uk/introduction">All the materials are available online</a> for you to follow at your own pace, which are in-depth and step-by-step. The website is worth a look for inspiration, anyway, as there is a great <a class="secondary-link" href="https://dayofcode.co.uk/showcase">showcase </a>of the delegates' creations.
