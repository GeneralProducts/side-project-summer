        <h2>Side projects liberate you</h2>
        <p>
          No matter what your goal – learning a new technology, making some money, achieving something in an area you care about – side projects are liberating. In an era where we are all increasingly obligated to do what other people want (who else is going to deliver work projects, pay the bills, do the school run, and generally make sure the wheels don't fly off?) side projects are a chance to do something just for yourself. It gives you agency, self-belief and happiness.
        </p>
        <h2>Side projects help your employer</h2>
        <p>
          The beauty of a technical side project is that it helps your employer, especially if they support you in your efforts. Here's what your employer gets out of it:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Staff retention</strong>
              The best employment perks are those that money can’t buy: time to work on your own project and skills is invaluable and makes you stand out from other employers.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Good use of dead time</strong>
            Productivity slumps on a Friday afternoon. Reclaim this time!</li>

            <li><strong>Source of creativity and innovation</strong>
            Given free rein, people come up with all sorts of interesting ideas. Use side-projects to test out innovations, new
            skills and new directions, before committing budget to them at work.</li>

            <li><strong>Staff-led, free, self-managed training</strong>
            As well as requiring no oversight or budget, Friday afternoon side-project sessions often provide enthusiasm to continue
            into the weekend. As an employer, you get a lot of staff skills training for a very small investment.</li>
