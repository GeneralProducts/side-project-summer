          The General Products team ran a Day of Code at the last FutureBook conference, which saw 40 publishers create their own book marketing website from raw ONIX metadata.
          <a  href="https://dayofcode.co.uk/introduction">All the materials are available online</a> for you to follow at your own pace, which are in-depth and step-by-step. The website is worth a look for inspiration, anyway, as there is a great <a  href="https://dayofcode.co.uk/showcase">showcase </a>of the delegates' creations.

          <span class="badge badge-learning-by-doing">Prefer learning by doing</span>
          <span class="badge badge-advanced">Advanced</span>
          Use JavaScript to improve the page you're currently reading to enable a user to click on the badges to filter the results. I have no idea where I would start with that, but you might!

          <strong>Scrape Amazon for data</strong>
          <span class="badge badge-advanced">Advanced</span>

          <span class="badge">Prefer tutorials</span>
          Everyone has things they have to do in familiar programs that are repetitious. Ditch the drudge by writing macros – programs that automate some of those actions. Google "Excel macros", "Photoshop droplets", and "Word macros" for inspiration and tutorials.

          <span class="badge badge-motivated-by-visuals">Motivated&nbsp;by&nbsp;visuals</span>
