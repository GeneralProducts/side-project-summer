      <h3>Our Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>Project leadership is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take
        appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, in online forums regarding the

        complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and
        appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the
        reporter of an incident.
      </p>
